                <p style="text-align: justify;">Hippocrates famous quote, “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food” — which we translated to “food is medicine” and used as Nutrition motto. Still to this day medical doctors and historians consider Hippocrates to be the founder of Medicine. Hippocrates was ahead of his time when, around the year 400 B.C, advised that prevention and treatment of diseases first and foremost by eating a nutrient-dense diet.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The Ancient Greeks weren’t the only ones to propagate this. Many traditional systems of healing which have been practiced throughout history — including Ayuvedic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine, for example — have taught for thousands of years that food is medicine and a healthy diet is a powerful tool for protecting one’s health.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Why is a calorie not just a calorie when it comes to your health, and how come it matters so much which types of foods you get your calories from? Foods provide us with energy (calories), but they do much more than that. Foods you include in your diet plays a critical role in controlling inflammation levels, helping digestive organs to process and eliminate waste,stabilising blood pressure and cholesterol levels, balancing blood sugar, regulating cardiovascular health, and much more.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Studies and research show nutrient deficiencies and toxicity from a poor diet are linked to nearly all modern health conditions. We already know that diabetes and <b>heart disease</b> (currently the No. 1 killer in our country and most industrialized nations) are also illnesses that are highly influenced by one’s diet — and the same can be said for allergies, autoimmune disorders like arthritis, thyroid disorders and many more.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Nutritional factors are implicated in the causes of 6 of the 10 leading causes of death in the: heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, cancer, adult-onset (type II) diabetes, arteriosclerosis, and alcohol-induced cirrhosis. The role of diet in both the prevention and treatment of many conditions, such as obesity, osteoporosis, gastrointestinal disorders, low birth weight, dental caries, iron-deficiency anaemia, and certain vitamin and mineral deficiencies, is clearly documented. As a result of these developments and new data linking environmental factors and lifestyle to health and illness, medical attention is shifting to the prevention and treatment of chronic and degenerative diseases, most of which have a complex etiology. Diet is not only a factor in the cause of these diseases but also is important in their treatment.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">At Qua Nutrition, our nutrition experts use evidence based nutrition therapies to provide you with exclusively customized nutrition plans for a better healthy lifestyle. We also give you suggestions about the essential nutrients you need to take to prevent any deficiencies.</p>
                <h3>Diabetes:</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"> Being a diabetic does not always mean that the patient should deviate from the normal diet completely. The aim of a diabetic diet should be to control blood sugar and maintain an adequate nutritional status. Your body requires a healthy balance of blood-sugar levels to function properly.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">At Qua Nutrition, the nutrition experts and certified diabetes educators understand the physiology of the body that produces little or no insulin.

                <h3>Hypertension:</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Hypertension cannot be cured, but it can be controlled through lifestyle changes and prescriptive medication. Research has shown that necessary dietary change can help treat and often delay or prevent high blood pressure.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">People trying to control hypertension are often advised by medical consultants to decrease sodium, increase potassium, watch their calories, and maintain a reasonable weight. How does one do all of this?</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">We at Qua Nutrition with the team of expert nutritionists will customize a nutrition plan to keep you healthy and prevent the development of any further complications. Check a specific hypertension and salt sensitivity gene in the nutrition gene test.</p>
                <h3>Heart Disease:</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Weight control and regular exercise are critical for keeping your heart in shape—but the food you eat may matter just as much. Experts say that eating a heart-healthy diet can reduce your risk of heart disease or stroke by 80%. By understanding how your food choices impact the health of your heart, you may be able to prevent or manage heart disease and high blood pressure.</p>

Diet plays a vital role in preventing and managing the onslaught of arthritis. Evidence is accumulating that anyone with arthritis can benefit from a diet that provides adequate macronutrients and micronutrients.  For instance, weight management can help lower cholesterol and blood pressure. Having a healthy weight can also improve mobility, and contribute to overall wellbeing and health.</p>

                <h3>Osteoporosis</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Osteoporosis is a major cause of bone fractures in postmenopausal women and the cause of significant morbidity among elderly persons.  Inadequate calcium, vitamin D, estrogens, and fluoride are among the many factors that have been implicated in the cause of this disease </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Various studies have examined the influence of nutritional factors on calcium absorption and excretion, the metabolic factors contributing to alterations in bone structure, and practical means for preventing and treat-its osteoporosis. </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">At Qua Nutrition, the team of expert nutritionists and dietitians will work with you to help you combat the effects of osteoporosis and work in tandem with your medical advisor to bring back the strength in your bones.</p>
                <h3>Cancer:</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Nutritional rehabilitation and support are integral parts of the treatment regimen for cancer patients. The metabolic stress of cancer, the interactions between nutrients and drugs, and the post-tumour relationship are subjects of active research. It is believed some 80% of cancer patients are believed to be malnourished, and that treatments used to battle cancer (like chemotherapy) only increase the body’s need for nutrients and very high-quality foods even more.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore to prevent malnutrition, it is important to give your body a constant supply of nutrients to use as fuel during the healing process. Maintaining optimal nutrition during cancer treatment is essential to enhance its effectiveness and ensure that your treatment goes uninterrupted. Your body needs more "fuel" than normal, because it has to repair rapidly from the effects of cancer treatments such as surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">At Qua Nutrition, the team of expert nutritionists and dietitians who understand the science of cancer will work with you to help you nourish your body during cancer treatment and throughout the recovery process. With extensive research and evidence based therapies, we will provide you with customized nutrition plan giving you the necessary combination of foods and supplements to speed your path to better health. You have already won a battle with cancer; let’s together get your lifestyle back.</p>

                      <p class="text-white font-13">Dhanashree Rabha has been my nutritionist at Qua Nutrition. A firm but an understanding approach, she has helped me come closer to my goal of #fitatfifty and #fithealthyhappy. The weights have been a by product, but the real change has been inside. My blood reports are near perfect now, after nine months of guidance. I now take one-third the diabetes medication I used to, my cholesterol is well in control of being out of the charts. My other parameters are slowly aligning themselves to normal ranges. I am very impressed by Dhanashree's approach - no BIG changes to an already clean diet, but she helped me realign my food in such a manner that I would not have sugar spikes or lows through the day. Result: Hba1c normal, high energy levels, fewer mood swings. Life is beautiful.</p>

                      <p class="text-white font-13">I have been associated with QUA Nutrition since June 2014. My goal was not just weight loss but to make myself fitter. I started with cholesterol levels above normal, borderline sugar and high uric acid. I am very happy to report that in addition to losing around 7.5kgs in four months, all the parameters listed above became normal. I was advised a regime which I found no difficulty in following as it took into account my likes/ dislikes in food, my lifestyle and my current exercise regimen. There were course corrections made on a continual basis, depending on how I was faring. Janeline, my dietitian, was in regular touch and I felt connected. I would like to thank both Janeline and QUA for instilling a sense of ‘health consciousness’ in me.</p>

                    <p class="mt-0 mb-0 p-10 text-center">They have changed the way I feel about food, they educate you a lot and you feel empowered to make the right choices. My nutritionist was very patient with me while I went through the lifestyle change of eating on time, small portions, avoiding Thyroid resresist food, etc. The plans are extremely customized, discussed after full body analysis and blood test results. I went there after seeing my colleague recover from high sugar related issues, he lost a lot of fat and started looking upto 10 years younger. If you are looking for improving overall health then Qua is the place. The food plan they provide is a lot of work, so be prepared to embrace the change. They do cost much more than regular dietician in hospitals, but worth the money.</p>
