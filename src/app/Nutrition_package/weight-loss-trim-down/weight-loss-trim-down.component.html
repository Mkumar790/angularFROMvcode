                  <div class="col-md-6"> <p>The reason why all the diets and the self-help books do not help, because they were designed for maybe one person in the whole world, and that person isn’t You ! The solution is to find a nutritionist, who will help you make that diet for you that will work, and it sticks, and give you long standing results. They can help you understand the science behind how food fuels your body, how to achieve balance in your food choices, and provide accountability to keep you on track. </p>

                 <p style="margin-top: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;">It is not about eating less, but eating right and in the correct quantity that will help you lose weight and keep it off. Losing weight and losing weight in a healthy manner are two very different things. Learning how to lose weight—while eating healthy and avoiding nutritional deficiencies—is key to sustaining good health and even keeping the weight off.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;">It is not about following a diet, it is about following a program for you. The biggest mistake with dieters is that they go into a diet with the intention of being overly strict on what they allow themselves to eat. The problem is that when they slip up and cheat, they see it as absolute failure and quit the entire idea. The result is a retiring back to old, bad habits. You need to approach dieting with a flexible mind-set, allowing yourself to have food, here and there, that goes along with the program through a guided approach, of a nutritionist who understands when to pull you back. Otherwise, you will drive yourself nuts and end up worse off than when you started.</p>

                <h3>Women:</h3>
                <p>It is not just that time of the month. And it is not just one week of going on a cleanse and wondering why a month later you've gained back the weight. We are talking about a consistent lack of ability to lose weight despite doing all the right things like working out, eating right, and getting enough sleep.  </p>
                <p> There is a lot more to good nutrition than meets the eye. Meeting with a Qua Nutrition nutritionist can help evaluate some of your pitfalls you may not be aware of. </p>
                <p>Losing weight is every woman's nemesis.</p>
                <p>You want to fit into that outfit you loved at the store so you start off by starving yourself. Not to forget the well-meaning advice from well-wishers on how to lose weight. Nothing seems to work because what worked for others is not the plan that was designed for your body type. No wonder you are close to giving up, and feel that this is your last chance.</p>
                <p>A sensible weight loss program allows you to lose weight slowly. It can range from 500gms to 1Kg per week. Gradual weight loss promotes loss of body fat instead of water loss from the body, which is harmful and gets replenished very fast. At Qua Nutrition the team of nutritionists will design a customized nutrition plan that works in way that your body would respond best to.</p>
                <p>At Qua Nutrition Health our nutrition experts will hand hold you through the process of losing weight by designing a nutrition plan with supplement strategy exclusively for you. So go ahead and binge on that slinky outfit!</p>
                <h3>Men:</h3>
                <p>Gone are the days when a beer gut, a fart and a burp were considered manly. Everyone knows that belly fat is nothing to joke about. To lose that gut, you probably started with some small exercises but in the absence of any noticeable difference, you are not motivated to continue. You look towards advice of your better looking friends, trainers, search engines and self-suggesting supplements. You could end up with a screwed up gut, system or back as you haven’t planned a nutrition plan for your goals. </p>
                <p>Do you know loosing fat is 70 % nutrition and 30 % exercise? </p>
                <p>What you need is a customized nutrition plan clubbed with those small efforts you are taking to lose that increasing waist line. At Qua Nutrition, the team of expert nutritionists will work with you and design a nutrition plan and supplement strategy exclusively suiting your body chemistry and metabolism. Cheers in saying goodbye to that belly fat.</p>
                <h3>Children </h3>
                <p>Childhood obesity can lead to diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. There may be no symptoms other than weight that's above normal. Improving the entire family's diet and exercise habits is one of the best ways to achieve a healthy weight in the child. Children become overweight for a variety of reasons. The most common causes are lack of physical activity, unhealthy eating habits, genetic factors or a combination of these factors. There will be rare cases in which being overweight is caused by a medical condition such as a hormonal problem. A child's total diet and activity level play the important role in determining a child's weight. </p>
                <p>Besides the medical implication of excess weight, it does have emotional and psychological changes on the child as well.</p> 
                <p>Best is to find a long term solution and work with a specialised Child Nutritionist at Qua Nutrition, who can help understanding the relevant changes that you need to make to get your child in frame of correct health and weight. </p>

Qua Nutrition was suggested by my sister to try out their techniques to reduce weight due to the</p><p class="mt-0 mb-0 p-10 pt-0 text-center collapse" id="block-id321"> increasing risk of obesity i was going through. Ms.Suhasini, of Qua Nutrition TTK Road Chennai, an acquaintance of my sister, was mentoring me. Initially,my body mass data's, like body fat% in various parts, muscle% were recorded. And then a detail analysis of my existing food pattern was taken note of, and a suitable diet alteration to be followed was suggested, much feasible given the extra effort to avoid deviating from diet, along with proper workout schedule to be followed meticulously. Ms.Suhasini, regularly did a follow up session every week on phone, since i was unable to attend physical check-ups every week. During the monthly scheduled check-ups, my body mass data was recorded, and the progress observed through pie charts was given as comparison to contrast the actual progress, one of the important driving factors to continue further. Precisely, my target and the rate at which i was going towards it was being highlighted. Having followed the diet schedule for 6 months with as minimal deviations as possible, I was finally able to reach two digit figures of 99 kilos, which was a huge achievement of many standards for me. Presently, exactly after a year, i weigh about 85kilos, which is a decent BMI for a 6'3" guy. The confidence, and the change which was very distinctly visible physically, brought in appreciation for the effort from all around. My wholehearted gratitude to Ms.Suhasini and Qua Nutrition for having motivated me throughout this entire process. I would 100% recommend this to anyone expecting significant weight loss with constant motivation, and trust me it's worth every penny you pay for it. Not only did i lose weight, but i actually learnt what eating "healthy", and staying fit meant. Cheers to Qua Nutrition for an amazing job. <br>&nbsp;</p>

My weight was perfectly normal and I would appear normal to every other person, but tests showed otherwise. Like an average Indian, my fat percentage was way higher than what it should be. Additionally, I had also imposed a challenge on myself - I am to run a Half Marathon by 31st of this month (May 31). It was no joke to me - I hadn't run more than 10k ever. I got to know about Ryan and Qua through a friend. Ryan was very helpful and connected me to their clinic in Chennai. Suhasini, from their Chennai clinic, has been helping me out since then and in a month's time - with exercise and the charts provided by them, my body fat dropped by 2%! She also helps me out with any queries I have, found me the right supplements for my runs and handles all queries super quickly. I would definitely recommend them to friends, family, anybody looking for a visible change for their problems (like BP, Sugar, stress, acne, etc). After all, we are what we eat ;)"<br>&nbsp;</p>
