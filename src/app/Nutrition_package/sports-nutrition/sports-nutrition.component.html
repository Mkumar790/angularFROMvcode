                <p style="text-align: justify; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px; margin-top: 20px;">Many athletes do not understand the impact of proper nutrition on athletic performance and health. Nutrition is a key ingredient to optimizing athletic performance. Properly fuelling and refuelling the body is essential to reaching an individualâ€™s full athletic potential. Food selection, quantity as well as meal timing affect body composition, athletic performance, and overall health. Yet, athletes generally tend to have limited knowledge of nutrition. Surveys on nutrition knowledge demonstrate that athletes have many misconceptions about the role of nutrition in performance</p>
                <p>Did you know that nutrition is typically the missing link to optimizing athletic potential? The key to improving your performance is to find the weak link. What's holding you back? Are you tired between training sessions? Do you recover slowly? Are you looking to reduce your body fat? Improving energy and performance means looking at the big picture. There is no one single nutrition program for the endurance athlete-not even for the same sport and position. Knowing how to properly fuel and refuel your body is essential to maximizing your sports performance. Donâ€™t wait. Get an edge on the competition and schedule a sports performance nutrition session today.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;margin-top: 20px;">There are many factors that are evaluated when we work with an athlete. First of all it is important to have a program that's realistic and that fits your lifestyle. Whether you're competing or training off-season, the length and intensity of the sport and unique health situations will also determine your nutritional requirements. The program is then customized to meet the needs of your body and the demands of your sport. Just as the finely tuned engine runs at its best with high-octane fuel, we teach the athlete how to maximize performance with the correct nutrition, and help them understand how their body can perform and recover most effectively. No matter how well you train, your body is limited by certain key factors which can be optimized with a high performance nutrition program designed and customized specifically for your needs and goals.</p>
                <h3>WHY ARE WE THE BEST SPORTS NUTRITION CLINIC </h3>

                <p style="font-weight: 700;margin-top: 20px;">Success in endurance sports is not just about training. Take your nutrition as seriously as you do your training and get an edge on the competition!</p>
                <p>Qua Nutrition offers private consultations in addition to online nutrition counselling and telephone support to athletes from all over the world. Every athlete is unique and therefore needs a program geared specifically to meet their individual needs. All programs are carefully developed based on cutting edge science and Ryan Fernandoâ€™s knowledge and expertise in working with athletes from every area of sports. Sessions are tailored to your personal ability, goals and available time.</p>
                <p>Whether youâ€™re a professional athlete or a weekend warrior, nutrition is fundamental to your athletic performance. The right diet will optimise your energy levels and help your body recover more effectively. You need to provide your body with enough energy (calories) to meet the demands of training and enable proper recovery between exercise/ training sessions. Training or competition generally increase daily energy requirements depending on duration, type and intensity of the activity. </p>

But after joining QUA is when I realized how much of my old habits I needed to change in order to be the best athlete I can be mentally and physically. I have been working with Lakshmi and Ryan for a few months now and their inputs and meal plans have been able to take my game and training to another level. I have seen a huge difference so soon after working with them. Their knowledge and expertise is something I count on almost everyday whether itâ€™s during training or playing tournaments. Very Fortunate to have Ryan and Lakshmi on my team to help me be the best athlete I can be.</p>

When I started off at Qua Nutrition 4 years ago, I got a good idea of what a balanced meal should consist of and how to eat three solid meals through the day. Over time I've learned about different kinds of food and how they affect and contribute to my well-being and performance through the diet plans I have followed. The team at Qua -both Ryan Fernando and Lygia Correia constantly keep a tab on my body parameters and together we work to improve on them. My main improvement has been on the gold course. Knowledge of what to eat pre, during and post my tournament rounds, practice session, and workouts has helped me stay energetic and focused on my goals.</p>
